<p>Christ the Redeemer is a statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It was built between 1922 and 1931 and stands 30 metres tall. It sits on a 8 metres pedestal on the peak of the 700-metre. Construction started in 1926 and took five years. During that time workers balanced themselves on scaffolds with no safety equipment. It was risky work but during the entire construction period, no workers were killed. Many regarded that as a miracle. It was built to celebrate the 100 year anniversary of Brazil's independence from Portugal.</p>
