<p>Machu Picchu is a pre-Columbian 15th-century Inca site in Peru, in South America. The Incas built the city on a mountain ridge, 2430m above sea level. They lived there between 1200 and 1450 AD. Other people lived there before about 650 AD. The Incas built houses, fields and temples by cutting the rock on the mountain so it was flat. They built an observatory to look at the stars. Machu Picchu is very difficult to get to because it is so high in the mountains. It has only one way in and a stone wall to protect it.	</p>
